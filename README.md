# Scoreboarding-Architecture-Simulator
Implementation of a computer simulator that uses the Scoreboarding algorithm, capable of interpreting a text file with a pseudocode similar to Assembly MIPS. It does not have a branch predictor, so whenever there is a _conditional branch_ instruction a _stall_ is applied directly in the fetch stage.
